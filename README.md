# Siete-y-Medio

For the first PIC10C assignment, we will be coding the game of Siete-y-medio!


1. 14th April- The initial commit was of course initializing the git repository, together with a readme file and a few gitignore files (to ignore certain C++ files)


2. 14th April- The second commit is where the project was begun and added to the repo. Code was copied straight from the assignment description and the readme was updated. 


3. 14th April- The third commit involved filling out the three classes as much as possible for the time being. No testing has begun as of yet.
